###Hogan.js Partials support in Express 3.x

Just a quick template engine I whipped one day as I didn't want anything too complicated. Also includes a timed hash table as a simple cache. This part will be separated out to it's own repo one day along with a bunch of other datastructures I've got lying around.

Note that I haven't written any tests for this yet, so it may very well break and contain bugs.
